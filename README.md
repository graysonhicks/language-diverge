# Human vs. Computer Language

## A site to display data comparing the emergence, growth, decline, and extinction of human and computer languages.

Why does the number of human languages continue to decrease as time goes on?

Why does the number of programming languages continue to increase?

Will programming languages eventually begin to consolidate?

I've been curious of these questions, and while I don't have an answer for them, I built this site to display data that may be relevant and helpful to discussions around them.
